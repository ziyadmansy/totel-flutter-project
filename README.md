# Totel - Hotels rooms reservation app
It is hotel rooms sharing app that is still under development and is available as an open-source project by me to share the clean and scalable architecture pattern of the project.<br/>
Totel app enables US users to post their reserved rooms to share them with other partners to share the cost fees. It enables users to reserve hotel rooms and share them after.<br/>
It is designed with Domain-Driven design(DDD) with a very clean, scalable and maintainable architecture.<br/>
